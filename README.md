- 👋 Hi, I’m a Computer Science student from Austria
- 💻 I really love to code in C++ / Python and currently I'm trying to learn some Rust 
- 📊 Saving milestones of Software Projects is the reason why I created this account, whether they stem from university assignments or from private endeavors.
- 🌔 I love to aimlessly stroll around cities in sombre moonlight.
- 🏋️ Also like to throw stuff over my head as an olympic weightlifter
